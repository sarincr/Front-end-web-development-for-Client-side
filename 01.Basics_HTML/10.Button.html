<h1>HTML Website</h1>
<p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript. </p>

<p style="color:blue;">A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused. A search engine is a website that provides links to other websites. However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed.</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">Web browsers are used on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. In 2020, an estimated 4.9 billion people used a browser. The most used browser is Google Chrome, with a 63% global market share on all devices, followed by Safari with 19%. Other notable browsers include Firefox and Microsoft Edge.

  Most browsers have these user interface (UI) features:
  <ul>
      
    <li> Allow the user to open multiple pages at the same time, either in different browser windows or in different tabs of the same window.</li>
    <li> Back and forward buttons to go back to the previous page visited or forward to the next one.</li>
    <li> A refresh or reload and a stop button to reload and cancel loading the current page. (In most browsers, the stop button is merged with the reload button.)</li>
    <li> A home button to return to the user's home page.</li>
    </li><li> An address bar to input the URL of a page and display it.</li>
    <li> A search bar to input terms into a search engine. (In some browsers, the search bar is merged with the address bar.)</li>
</ul>
There are also niche browsers with distinct features. One example is text-only browsers that can benefit people with slow Internet connections or those with visual impairments.
